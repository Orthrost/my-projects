# my-projects
Test task

For this project I used Maven, Spring framefork and H2 in-memeory database.

I ran into a problem running this project from the command line using jetty. The application works fine
when I run it within eclipse using jetty. For some reason the neccessary bean cannot be defined when runnig from the command line.
Exactly the same thing happens when trying to it on a tomcat server.

At the beginnig of the project I tested if I can ran the application from the command line and everything worked. So during the development I ran it through Eclipse because it was faster. But when I finished and tried to run it again from the cmd line it did't work and I was unable to work out why.

The application should run on either port 8080 or 9898.
